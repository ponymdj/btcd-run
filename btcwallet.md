Enter the private passphrase for your new wallet: 
Confirm passphrase: 
Do you want to add an additional layer of encryption for public data? (n/no/y/yes) [no]: n
Do you have an existing wallet seed you want to use? (n/no/y/yes) [no]: n
Your wallet generation seed is:
7f8b6ab56c2f3d2a33b1dcd1cbbed2f248d18d41266c550be45de4fe9b9a63be
IMPORTANT: Keep the seed in a safe place as you
will NOT be able to restore your wallet without it.
Please keep in mind that anyone who has access
to the seed can also restore your wallet thereby
giving them access to all your funds, so it is
imperative that you keep it in a secure location.
Once you have stored the seed in a safe and secure location, enter "OK" to continue: OK
